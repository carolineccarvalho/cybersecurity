What is the OSI model?
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a description of how the internet works. It divides the functions involved in sending data over the internet into seven layers. Each layer has some function that prepares data to be sent over wires, cables, and radio waves as a series of bits.

The seven layers of the OSI model are:

7. Application layer: data generated and usable by application software. The main protocol used in this layer is HTTP .
6. Presentation layer: Data is translated into a form that the application can accept. Some authorities consider HTTPS encryption and decryption to occur at this layer.
5. Session layer: controls connections between computers (this can also be handled at layer 4 by the TCP protocol ).
4. Transport layer: provides the means to transmit data between the two connected parties as well as control the quality of service. The main protocols used here are TCP and UDP .
3. Network layer: deals with routing and sending data between different networks. The most important protocols at this layer are IP and ICMP.
2. Data link layer: handles communications between devices on the same network. If layer 3 is a mailing address, layer 2 indicates the office or apartment number at that address. The most used protocol here is Ethernet.
1. Physical layer: packets are converted into electrical, radio or optical pulses and transmitted as bits (the smallest possible units of information) over wires, radio waves or cables.
